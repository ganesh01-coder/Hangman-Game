# Hangman-Game
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that is typically played between two people, but can also be played solo against a computer. The game revolves around one player (the "word setter") selecting a word or phrase, and the other player(s) (the "guessers") attempting to guess the word by suggesting individual letters. The game is enjoyed for its simplicity and suspenseful gameplay.

# How-to-play
<ul>
  <li>The application randomly selects a word or phrase from a predefined list. This word or phrase is typically kept hidden from the player.</li>
  <li>It will displays the word or phrase to the player using underscores or dashes to represent each letter. For example, a four-letter word might be displayed as "_ _ _ _".</li>
  <li>The player guesses individual letters of the word or phrase by inputting them via the keyboard.</li>
  <li>If the player guesses a letter that is part of the word or phrase, the computer reveals all occurrences of that letter in the displayed word or phrase.
For example, if the word is "apple" and the player guesses "p," the computer updates the displayed word to "_ p p _ _".</li>
  <li>The player will get only 6 chances to guess the word.</li>
  <li>The player wins the game if they successfully guess the entire word or phrase before the Hangman is fully drawn.
The player loses the game if the Hangman is fully drawn before they correctly guess the word or phrase.</li>
</ul>
